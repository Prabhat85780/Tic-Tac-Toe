Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking the spaces in the grid, one with "X" and the other with "O." The objective of the game is to be the first player to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

Rules:
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square.
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
